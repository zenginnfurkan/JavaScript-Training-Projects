# CustomSlider with JS
*Hello there, I designed a simple slider with JavaScript. Images may change sequentially or randomly. We can also switch to the previous and next image with the help of arrows. When we hover over the arrows, the slider stops and we can switch. It continues again when you leave the arrows.*


*The pictures I used in the slider are from pexels.com*
