# Hangman Game with JS
*Hello, I designed a simple hangman game with JavaScript. We are trying to find the words determined by entering letters. When the same letter is entered, an error is displayed with a pop-up window. Also, incorrectly entered letters are displayed at the top right. When we find the word or lose the game, a pop-up window will appear again with the message "Congratulations" or "Unfortunately you lost.". (with Play again button)*
